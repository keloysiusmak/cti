This repository builds on the CTI Repository by adding the list of techiques into a corresponding json.

# cti
The Cyber Threat Intelligence Repository of ATT&amp;CK and CAPEC catalogs expressed in STIX 2.0 JSON. See [USAGE](USAGE.md) or [USAGE-CAPEC](USAGE-CAPEC.md) for information on using this content with [python-stix2](https://github.com/oasis-open/cti-python-stix2).

## ATT&CK
ATT&CK is a catalog of techniques and tactics that describe post-compromise adversary behavior on typical enterprise IT environments. The core use cases involve using the catalog to analyze, triage, compare, describe, relate, and share post-compromise adversary behavior.

## STIX
Structured Threat Information Expression (STIX™) is a language and serialization format used to exchange cyber threat intelligence (CTI).

STIX enables organizations to share CTI with one another in a consistent and machine readable manner, allowing security communities to better understand what computer-based attacks they are most likely to see and to anticipate and/or respond to those attacks faster and more effectively.

STIX is designed to improve many different capabilities, such as collaborative threat analysis, automated threat exchange, automated detection and response, and more.

## CAPEC

Understanding how the adversary operates is essential to effective cyber security. CAPEC™ helps by providing a comprehensive dictionary of known patterns of attacks employed by adversaries to exploit known weaknesses in cyber-enabled capabilities. It can be used by analysts, developers, testers, and educators to advance community understanding and enhance defenses.

 - Focuses on application security
 - Enumerates exploits against vulnerable systems
 - Includes social engineering / supply chain
 - Associated with Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE)
